### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): ??? Some amount since I was rusty in C, idk
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): ??? Not as many for optimizations outside of mul; I seemed to have made a lot of mistakes with indexing
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>How big the increase in speed was, it was pretty cool. mul_matrix was definitely the most interesting (and annoying) to implement due to all the issues with indexing or pointer arithmetic</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>how much SWE have to do to try and get every bit of speedup / optimization, the concept of vectorizing vs. unrolling was pretty interesting </b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>Nope, it was a pretty good exercise. Would be nice if it had been due sometime earlier though.</b>
